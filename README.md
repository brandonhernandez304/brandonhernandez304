👋 Hi, my name is Brandon and I am an aspiring full stack software engineer trying to learn everything that I can. Learning new things and sharing that new knowledge with others has always been a passion of mine that has been ingrained in me since my first days of mixed martial arts training. Coming from a background where there are always new things to learn and many opportunities to perfect the techniques you already know, software engineering feels like a fitting discipline to step into. Join me here on my page as I continue to learn publicly, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
- 👀 I’m interested in... all things exercise science + fitness related, fighting games (street fighter is my fave), comics + manga
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
