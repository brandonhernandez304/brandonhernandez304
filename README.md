## ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you, I'm Brandon
I am an aspiring full stack software engineer trying to learn everything that I can. Learning new things and sharing that new knowledge with others has always been a passion of mine that has been ingrained in me since my first days of mixed martial arts training. Coming from a background where there are always new things to learn and many opportunities to perfect the techniques you already know, software engineering feels like a fitting discipline to step into. Join me here on my page as I continue to learn publicly, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
## ðŸ‘€ Interests Aside from Coding
New tech (I've built my own computer so I love keeping up with the latest on hardware), all things exercise science + fitness related, fighting games (street fighter is my fave), comics + manga
